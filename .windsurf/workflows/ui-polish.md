# UI Polish

1. Audit key surfaces (Layout, PromptCanvas, AgentInterface) to note rough edges.
2. Update shared layout styles for background, spacing, and panel framing.
3. Enhance buttons/toggles with clearer states and micro-interactions.
4. Refresh typography scale and subtle cards (shadows, borders, blurs).
5. Add helper affordances (labels, empty states) where missing.
6. Verify responsive behavior for sidebar/agent drawer and key flows.
7. Smoke test: load landing, open project mock, toggle tabs/sidebar/agent.
